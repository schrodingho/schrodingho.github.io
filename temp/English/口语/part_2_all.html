<li>街市购物(street) x<ul>
<li>Kuanzhai Alley</li>
<li>This topic reminds me of the time I went shopping in a well-known street market in Chengdu.The name of the street left a deep impression on me, it’s called kuanzai alley, which means wide and narrow. That place is warm and pleasant all year round, so it’ s a popular tourist spot in my country.</li>
<li>I went there with my friends about 2 months ago. We visited that street market at night because it’s too hot during the daytime. The temperature at night can be lower and the view of the alley is even more beautiful at night</li>
<li>Kuanzai alley is located at the center of Chengdu, near the People’s Park. It’s quite convenient to get there by taking subway line 4.</li>
<li>Anyway, the street features a variety of snacks in Sichuan Province. My friends and I are all foodies, so we bought different kinds of food, including dandan noodles, san da pao and so on. On both sides of the street, there are gift shops selling souvenirs, like panda toys, ear rings. I also bought a panda style iPhone case and it looks very cute. (You can also enjoy Sichuan opera in some theaters or restaurants）</li>
<li>It was quite a memorable night, this street market left me a deep impression. I was very satisfied with busy atmosphere and  palatable food there.</li>

<li><strong>做手工</strong> x<ul>
<li>I’d like to share with you an experience I had while I was taking art course in primary school.</li>
<li>I still remembered that the teacher taught us how to made a paper plane at that lesson. I had never made a paper plane before, so I imagined that if the paper plane was similar to the real plane, and how far paper plane car fly.</li>
<li>Before we started, the teacher first showed us how to fold a simple paper airplane with a piece of paper. It seemed like very easy. But when I tried it by myself, I found that I totally forgot the steps. So I asked my teacher for help. With teachers’ patient guidance, I folded the paper and finally turned it into a plane.</li>
<li>The appearance of paper plane was quite different from the real plane. Although both of them have wings, the paper plane’s wings look like simpler. Then I used my colorful pencils to draw some animals on the plane, such as fish, birds… I flew my paper plane and took these cute animals to the sky. The paper plane only flew a few meters away.</li>
<li>I think this activity is beneficial to develop students’ hands-on skills and learning abilities. At the same time, I can also use my imagination to make more interesting and different things, which would help me in the future.</li>
<li>(Now I have grown up, but I didn’t forget this experience. It always reminds me of the patience and passion of making a new thing. I should always have the kind of imagination and creativity that I had when I was young. )</li>

<li><strong>智力游戏</strong> x(拼图智力游戏，需要继续改写)<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/370347802">zhihu</a></li>
<li>I’m going to talk about the jigsaw puzzle. It consists of many pieces that have unique shapes. When you place the pieces in the right places, they will fit together very closely. Eventually, all of them in their correct locations will form the final big picture. I usually choose jigsaw puzzles that paint some cartoon characters.</li>
<li>The difficulty of the puzzle depends on several factors. The number and shape of pieces and the overall colour scheme determine the difficulty. A challenging one will have a few thousand pieces or very similar colours that cover most of the picture.</li>
<li>Usually, I spend two to four hours completing a large puzzle and the longest time I have taken to complete one puzzle is <strong>roughly</strong> twenty hours. The duration varies a lot depending on how tough it is</li>
<li>Putting together a jigsaw puzzle feels like a roller-coaster of emotions to me. When I face an obstacle in fitting the pieces together, I tend to feel frustrated and exasperated. I normally must convince myself to complete it. When I successfully finish it though, I always feel an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. The harder the puzzle is, the greater this sense of achievement I feel. Overall, this is a hobby I am happy to invest my time in.</li>

<li>微笑的场合 x<ul>
<li>After the College Entrance Examination</li>
<li>I am going to introduce you an occasion when many people were smiling. I rememebered that it happened at June 8th in 2018. It was not a simple day for chinese people, especially for the senior high students. At that day, we finished the college entrance examination and we would graduate from our school.</li>
<li>I still remembered that my classmates and I took the bus from exam site, we were welcomed by our teachers and lower class students. We were surprised and delighted by such a scene. The school held a special graduation ceremony for us. The headmaster of our school gave us a graduation message. He congratulated us on the successful completion of our high school education and wished us to pursue our dreams in the future. </li>
<li>For the reason why many people were smiling, you know, all of us had experienced very hard high school life. To enter a good university in the future, we had put efforts on study. And we all felt relieved because we won the war of CEE successfully!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>禁用手机的场合 x<ul>
<li>At the end of a term, I would have many final examinations. Moreover, if I have to take other examinations for certificate, for example, IELTS, I am also not allowed to use my mobile phone. Examinations normally are held in big classrooms, some classrooms are equipped with monitoring equipment, teachers would also supervise the students in the classroom if there is an examination. <br>Obviously, using mobile phone is forbidden in examinations. People who take exams with mobile phones are likely to cheat. You know, it’s quite easy for people to get access to the answers of the questions in examinations by using mobile phones. The information about the solutions is abundant <strong>on</strong> the Internet. To ensure the fairness of examination, mobile phones and other similar electronic products are not allowed to take into room for exam.<br>For me, I would support this rule without any hesitation. I always consider fairness as one of the most vital things in today’s society. It guarantees people have a same platform to compete with each other in examinations. We should use technologies like mobile phone in a right way but not to do harmful things to the society.</li>

<li><strong>当地新闻</strong> x (more)<ul>
<li>environmental protection news.</li>
<li>The local news I am going to tell you is a new subway line was opened in Chengdu. This subway starts from Pidu in the northwest and ends at the south of chengdu. The length of this line is about 68 kilometers and the train adopts 8-section formation type train. I remember it was reported in December last year. </li>
<li>I read this article online from Topfuzz, which is one of the most popular news application in China. It had a column about the Chengdu subway, which provided the latest progress of metro construction.</li>
<li>It was a piece of good news. New metro line provides more convenient transportation for the local people. For example, at past, if I want to enter the city center of Chengdu, it would cost me about 2 hours to transfer different means of transportation. Now, with the opening of the new subway line, it becomes quicker to get the city area than before, which largely benefits citizens’ daily commute and travel.</li>
<li>News related to infrastructure development always attracts people’s attention(catches people’s eyes) because it is closely related to their daily life. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>环保法律</strong> x</p>
<ul>
<li>air pollution</li>
<li>An environmental protection law that I particularly want to describe is the law on the Prevention of Air Pollution in China. </li>
<li>I first learned about this law from a piece of news in CCTV. It was said that this law was enacted(legislate?) in 1987. It seemed that our government paid attention to this problem at a early year. But the fact is that during the 30 years, the air pollution is becoming more and more serious. Many factories output toxic gas without any processing. The index of PM2.5 keeps increasing with the increasing number of GDP. So a new version of the Prevention of Air law was enacted in 2015 to enhance the penalty level of air pollution, which shows our government’s determination to deal with the air pollution problem.</li>
<li>When the new law was enacted, it had a huge positive impact on our air quality. In the past, we could even see factories that gave off waste gas in cities. After the law is enforced, some factories had been forced to close, and the number of smoggy days has dropped by a lot each year. We can breathe the fresh air and have outdoor activity without any anxiety.</li>
<li>I think this law is very necessary for air protection. We all know that air quality is highly related with our health. Polluted air will influence human’s respiratory system and even the whole body system. The implementation of the law guarantees the earth’s ecological environment and human health.</li>

<li><p><strong>健康文章</strong> x fruit rewrite</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to talk about an article about how to lose weight and keep body healthy that I read last year.</li>
<li>This article was posted on Zhihu, the most famous knowledge sharing platform in China. You can easily get access to many useful konwledge about health, medical and lifestyle.</li>
<li>I spent several mintues reading it. The article mainly explain how obesity affects physical health and the right way to lose weight. It told us obesity would lead to many diseases. If people do not pay attention to it, it will lead to cardiovascular disease and diabetes /ˌdaɪəˈbiːtiːz/.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, it introduced us the right way to lose weight. The first thing we need to pay attention to is eating. It is better to eat less rice which contains high sugar. Secondly, it suggested us to keep running to burn calorie every day.</li>
<li>For my feeling of this article, I think I benfitted a lot from it. You know, I am a little fat at young age, so I must notice this proqzblem and follow the advice in the article. I believe that a healthy body is very necessary for my development and future career. </li>

<li><p>想提升的天赋 x</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer programming skill</li>
<li>I really want to improve my computer programming skill.</li>
<li>Programming is a way to implement your idea by computer. You can write programs to boost efficiency of work and build system to manage something. Programming is quite useful for our life, but it can be a little difficult for us to learn and use it.</li>
<li>You know, when I was little child, I could get access to computer due to the help of my father. From that time, I started using computer to make my own programs. I still remembered that the first programming language I studied was HTML. To some extent, HTML can only concluded as a script language. Learning HTML didn’t cost me too much time and energy. After I entered university, I also had opportunities to learn other programming languages like C\Python\C++..</li>
<li>But now, I feel that my programming skills have been stagnant for a long time. I have to do something to improve this talent. First, I think I am supposed to learn deeper knowledge about programming. For example, compilation principle is very necessary for me to understand how programming language is invented. Secondly, I prepare to go to the famous universities in Europe or America to get know of the most advanced computer science to improve my programming skills.</li>

</li>
<li>当地雇佣很多员工的公司 x<ul>
<li>Tech Company</li>
<li>Well, I want to introduce you changhong, which is one of the biggest companies in my living area. Changhong was founded in 1956. At first changhong mainly produced military equipment, including radar, cable. After reforming and opening, Changhong imported a TV production line from Panasonic in Japan. After that, Changhong expanded their production lines and had the ability to produce different kinds of electronic products.</li>
<li>By reading the information on the official site of Changhong, I get know that changhong has employed about 30,000 people, including engineer, researcher, manager and assembly line workers.</li>
<li>Changhong also recruits a variety of people to enhance the company’s competence in the market. The proportion of R&amp;D staff exceeds thirty percent, which shows changhong’s determination to make better products.</li>
<li>For my feeling of this company, you know, Changhong is the most famous technology brand in my hometown, I always feel proud of Changhong’s reputation. My family have used the television of Changhong for more than 10 years, we all agree that the quality of changhong’s products are very nice. This company really leaves us a good impression</li>

<li>海边活动 x<ul>
<li>beach soccer</li>
<li>A leisure activity near the sea that I’d like to experience is the beach soccer</li>
<li>People who live near the sea most would like to play this sport. Especially in Brazil, beach soccer is very popular with the local citizens, they treat it as a part of their daily life.</li>
<li>As far as I know, there are not many things to prepare for playing beach soccer. But some necessary things can not be ignored. For example, a soccer is very necessary for this activity. You can not play with air. If finding a soccer difficult, some similar ball like volleyball can be a substitute. Moreover, two goals should be set in the beach for shooting. You don’t need to find two real metal goals, maybe four plastic bottles are enough.</li>
<li>It’s not difficult for people to take part in this activity. You just need to know how to kick the soccer and some rules about soccer. But if you want to control the game on the beach, I think it’s not easy, you need to have talent for soccer and practice more.</li>
<li>You know, I am a crazy soccer fan, I like playing soccer and I have never played soccer on the beach. So I really want to have a try to enjoy the happiness from soccer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>家庭重要设备 x<ul>
<li>Well, a piece of equipment that I think is essential in my home is actually the television. It was made by Changhong, which is a local company in my hometown.</li>
<li>I still remembered that we bought it in 2011. So we have used it for about 10 years. The size of the TV is 55 inches, and this TV also supports different kinds of signal inputs.</li>
<li>When I was at home during my high school years, I watched TV every weekend. I preferred to enjoy some documentaries about nature and universe. You know, tis TV has strong ability to restore the color, so I can enjoy the spetacular scenery of documentary. After I went to university, I seldom watch it beacause it was not convenient for me to go back home frequently.</li>
<li>Sometimes I would also watch movies with my parents on television. Our favorite movie type is comdies. We can get happiness from them and release our pressure from work and study.</li>
<li>For the reason why I think it is importatn. First, My family members and I can get entertianment by watching television. Second, family members have opportunities to get together to watch the same thing, which can strengthen the family tie.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>社交媒体趣事 x<ul>
<li>think for a while</li>
<li>About 2 months ago, I have seen many interesting news and funny comments in hupu. Hupu is a well-known application in China, which combines sports news and social media together.</li>
<li>At that time, there was a popular player in Premier League. And the player’s name is Jessy Lingard. He was a West Ham United player and he used to be a midfielder in Manchester. You know, due to his bad performance, he was loaned to West Ham from Manchester. But to our surprise, in the new team, lingard scored many magnificent goals and assisted west ham to enter the Europa League qualified area.</li>
<li>Lingard’s dramatic change impressed people in hupu. They made many interesting comments to praise Lingard. For example, emperor Lin was proposed by the fan of Man United to describe Lingard as the emperor of soccer. In fact, people used to use this nickname to mock Lingard. Some people</li>

<li>生活计划 <ul>
<li>trip to Beijing, the captital of China</li>
<li>My friend asked me if I want to pay a visit to Beijing. </li>
<li>I always have the desire to pay a visit to this great and sacred city, the heart of the republic.</li>
<li>Making a plan before the trip is very necessary. First, you have the opportunity to reserve cheaper air ticket and hotel. The saved money can be used for other activities like eating more delicious local food. </li>
<li>At first, I have to buy my round trip tickets in advance. As I mentioned before, the air ticket is normally cheaper. Secondly, I will find out what are the famous attractions in Beijing from travel guide websites. Usually I will arrange my trip and book hotels based on the location of these attractions.</li>
<li>If this trip can be successful, I will feel very relieved and satisfied. You know, arranging a trip is not a simple job, you have to consider about the price, the route, the restaurant and the feeling of your friend. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>不太成功的经历 x<ul>
<li>Well, I want to talk about the experience I write my first computer science conference paper.</li>
<li>I began to prepare it from last year. After I came back school, my tutor sent me some new papers and ask me if I can think about some new ideas. I read these papers and think up a new method. So I began to implement my idea into code and made experiments to evalutate the effectiveness of the new approach.</li>
<li>Although my method was novel and reasonable, the experimental results were not very ideal. The performance of my method exceeded some classic methods, but when it compared with some state-of-the-art methods, there is still a little gap.</li>
<li>Instead of giving up, I think I will insist on it and do more experiments. I make some plans to change the structure of the model. Maybe one day I can get the best result and achieve my goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span id="fenxiang">分享</span> x <ul>
<li>AI class</li>
<li>I want to share you an experience which happened at last year. The first lesson of AI fundamental.</li>
<li>You know, The main content of the first lesson is usually an introduction of the course. (Meanwhile, Students are not familiar with each other, and the atmosphere of the class is a bit cold due to the first class.) To activate the students’ interests, teacher asked us to talk something about AI application and AI future. Then we were allocated into 6 groups. I had to share ideas with another two students from other departments.</li>
<li>At beginning, we felt a little awkward to talk because we were not familiar with each other. Gradually, with more communications, we found that all of us were interested in this topic. I shared my idea that we could use AI to learn the contents from books. Then the AI can imitate wirters’ style and publish various books by itself. Another two people said that AI can be deployed in medical scenario. It can assist the doctor to examine the medical images like X-ray image, which can improve the accuracy of diagnosis.</li>
<li>For the reason why I share my idea, I think it’s necessary to speak up and communicate with others. Then you can know your strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li>I definitely believe that sharing is a good opportunity to learn many useful things and knowledge and it is also a valuable chance to make new friends who were talented in thinking up some novel ideas.</li>
</ul>

<li>朋友的争执 x (Math modeling)<ul>
<li>I’d like to share an argument my friends had last year when we were attending math modeling contest.</li>
<li>Math modeling contest is one of the most popular contests in my university. Every year many students would like take part in this contest and only the best team can win the prize. Normally, three students from different departments would cooperate in this competition.</li>
<li>The contest lasted for 3 days. At the first day, we discussed many problems and gradually thought up a novel idea. But my friend from computer science department considered that it was impossible to implement the idea into code, he proposed that this model should be changed largely. Another student from math science department didn’t think like him, she believed that there was no problem. So they made an argument towards this topic.</li>
<li>I thought it would be fruitless to keep arguing, so I told them we should find a way to solve the problem. After they calmed down, we got back into the problem solving process.</li>
<li>Finally our teammates won the second prize. We feel a little regret. You know, our cooperationwas not very harmony, we would make a quarrel about a little problem.I think we can get a better result if we participate this contest again in the future.</li>

<li>I’d like to introduce you a tall building which is called 339 in Chengdu.From its name, you can easily guess that the height of the Tower is 339 meters. It’s located at the northeast of chengdu, near the first ring road. That place is one of the busiest neighborhoods in Chengdu. Many citizens would like to go there for eating and entertainment.</li>
<li>Well, 339 Tower was originally built to propagate wireless signals. You know,  communication signals need high towers to spread farther. But now, it also has another function for sightseeing tours. People can take the fast elevator to get the top of the Tower, then they are able to see the panoramic view of Chengdu from the tower. If the weather is nice and air is clear, people can even see the tall sonwy mountains in the west of Sichuan Province.</li>
<li>Well, for the appearance of the tower, the bottom of the tower is a large base. As the height rises, the radius of the tower becomes smaller. The top of the tower is a long antenna to transmit signals.</li>

<li>I bought a Sony’s noise canceling headphone that made feel pleased about</li>
<li>I got a scholarship from my university, it’s not a big number, but I could use the money to buy something useful or what I want. I bought it online in JD mall during double 11 in 2019.Coincidently, the date was near the double 11(single’s day), which was china’s online shopping carnival. It was best time to buy things because things in double 11 would have lowest prices among the year. It’s similar with the Black Friday in US.</li>
<li>This headphone is mainly used for listening to music. （Well, I can’t exclude(rule out) the possibility of using this to listen to IELTS recordings.） But it also has a feature: noise canceling. This is the function that ordinary headphones don’t have. You just need to press the noise cancelling button, and most big noises from environment would be cut.</li>

<li><p>现场体育比赛</p>
<ul>
<li>I’d like to talk something about a live soccer match that I watched on my cellphone. It was a premier league match between mun and mci. You know, Manchester Derby, red against blue. I remembered that it was about 3 weeks ago. At 0 o’clock, I wore my headphone and opened my phone to watch it, At that time, my roommates had already slept, but I was so excited to watch the match.</li>
<li>You know, the derby game is always a fierce game. Although mun were 14 points behind MCI in the table, I had the confidence that mun can beat mci.</li>
<li>At the beginning of the match, Anthony Martial got the ball and created a penalty in opponent’s box. Bruno Fernandez successfully scored a penalty kick, Manchester United 1-0 Manchester City. Then mci kept its high possession of the ball. But with the guard of Dean Henderson and strong defenders, mun didn’t lose any ball. When mun caught the absence of mci’s defense, luke shaw ran into the box and scored a magnificent goal in the corner. It was amazing. When the referee blew the final whistle, mun won the game with two amazing goals.</li>
<li>From this game, mun taught me again that everything is possible. Although your rival is strong, you can find his drawbacks and beat them with opportunities. Secondly, we should learn to seize every chance to attack, because many useless attacks will make players feel tired. </li>

<li>Yeah, I have watched a variety of comedies. But my favorite one is called Lost on Journey. It’s China comedy which is acted by Xu zheng and Wang baoqiang. Almost everyone in china konws their names, because they are the most funny guys on the screen. I remembered that I watched this movie when I was 11 years old. My mother and I watched it together.</li>
<li>It tells a story a about two guys’ journey to their home before spring festival in china. There are many interesting plots, one of my favorite is at the beginning. The farmer acted by Wang Baoqiang and the boss acted by Xu Zheng met at the airport coincidently. The boss had witnessed the following plots: You know, when you take a plane, you’re not allowed to bring more than 100 milliliter. But the farmer took a big bottle of milk, and he was told that he must throw the milk before the security examination. But he thought it’s a pity to throw the milk, so he drank all the milk in one gulp. But from his expressions on his face, he used his all strength to drink the milk. It was really amazing and funny. I laughed loudly because of this plot. </li>

<li>The celebrity I am interested in is Wang Fei, who is a well-known singer in China.</li>
<li>How you knew: In 2010 ox year spring festival gala, Wang Fei had sung a song called legend. Her voice and appearance really left me a deep impression. From that time, I began to search information about her online and got to know her gradually.</li>
<li>Her clothes style is unusual and avant-garde. In her concert, she wouldn’t wear the ordinary costumes like other singers. Her own style always combines many different kinds of elements. Sometimes she would mix western style and Chinese style together. She would even create a novel style we haven’t seen. For example, in the concert of magic music, she tried a dress covered with black feathers and shining plastic. You couldn’t identify which style it was, you just wanted to say “That’s unusual and unique”.</li>
<li>For the reason why I think her clothes are unusual. First, I can’t identify the style of Wang Fei’s style. There were even hardly seen in a fashion show. Secondly, unusual may be not a good adjective to describe her style, because the mind of her style gives people a sense of creativity I think unique is more appropriate. </li>

<li>Where: I want to introduce you a trip to Wolong Natural Reserve in Sichuan Province, China. You know, Wolong Natural Reserve is well-known for the wild giant pandas. I went to the base with my two high school classmates. We were looking forward to seeing and getting close to the giant pandas. You know, although I’m Sichuan local, this was my first time to see the wild giant pandas.</li>
<li>It was a scorching day. We do have the opportunities to see the pandas very close. I remembered that some pandas were walking around and enjoying the shine. Some of them were sitting at the ground and enjoy their bamboos. But we also found some lazy pandas were sleeping. Their gesture of sleeping was really cute and funny. They just seemed to be very happy and I think they may had a better life than human.</li>
<li>I also took a lot of photos for these pandas. Although we called it wild animal, in fact they didn’t show any wild habit. They are so meek and lovely, and they really left me a deep impression. I really kept one panda in my home and play with it every day, but they are endangered animals, keeping pandas personally is forbidden.</li>
<li><em>(可忽略)When we entered the panda base, we couldn’t help ourselves seeing the pandas. But when we got close to the pandas, we found a large percentage of pandas were sleeping. We felt a little regretful, but their gesture of sleeping was really cute and funny.We asked the breeder why many pandas were sleeping. He told us the pandas used to live in the west Sichuan mountains. The climate there in summer was cool and wet. If the temperature went high, pandas would like to go to sleep to save their energy. Luckily, after our talking with the breeder, one of the pandas woke up and started his own show. +peacock +red panda(different giant pandas)</em></li>

<li>Well, I’d like to share an experience with you what happened one year ago. The person who I encouraged to do something was a younger female schoolmate. I got to know her by taking the same English class.</li>
<li>At that time, she was always nervous about her programming classes. She talked to me that she didn’t have any talents in learning programming language C and she even wanted to give up. But in my opinion, everyone had abilities to learn something well only if he/she concentrate on it. So I tried to encourage her to insist on learning this course. I told she this was a fundamental course of her major and she could deal with it easily if she practiced more and sought for helps when she met difficulties. </li>
<li>（At that time, she was always nervous about her programming classes. She talked to me that she didn’t have any talents in learning programming language C and she even wanted to give up. But I think it was not difficult to learn programming, so I gave her some useful advice. I told her the logic of programming and asked her to practice more and sought helps from me if she met some difficulties.）</li>
<li>At first, she was also a little afraid of programming. But with her efforts and other people’s help, the level of her programming skills had improved a lot than before. She even told me that she had the confidence to exceed me in programming skills one day. I was so happy that her attitude towards programming lessons had changed due to my encouragement.</li>
<li>For the reason why I encourage her to keep on learning, at first, I think everyone has the ability to learn something. Although something looks like so difficult, you should try and practice more to evaluate if you can do it. Secondly, it’s my pleasure to help others to overcome the fear in their heart. </li>
<li>（I think I could feel happy by encouraging others to do what they didn’t want to do. Helping others can always make people feel happy. When I found she could face the fear and overcome herself, there was a sense of achievement in my heart. ）</li>

<li>I remembered … I was using word writing a paper of my AI course. </li>
<li>Suddenly, the screen of the computer turned to blue and my work was interrupted</li>
<li>There were many numbers and letters on the screen, I guessed they are the memory addresses where the computer crash occurred(met a problem).</li>
<li>The last line in the blue screen was written that “Please restart your computer”. I was a little afraid, because I didn’t have a habit of saving files all the time. I worried that my unfinished work in word would disappear due to computer crash. </li>
<li>After I restarted the computer, I opened word application to see if there was something wrong. Luckily, word had a function to save my temporary work all the time. I clicked “recover” button and my works went back.</li>
<li>This lesson told me that computer crash could happen at any time, we don’t have methods to detect it. we must have the awareness to save our work at any time although some software had functions to protect your temporary works.</li>

<li>对家庭重要的东西<ul>
<li>My great-grandfather’s diary. </li>
<li>In 2006, my family got this important thing. In that year, my great-grandfather passed away and ended his legendary life. When we sorted through his belongings, we found his diary in the wardrobe and a big bag of letters. The diary recorded all his experiences from 1930 to 2000. It’s not a simple diary, it contains his unbelievable experiences and legendary life. My great-grandfather used to be a military officer in KMT, he was also a student from Huangpu Military School, which was the most famous military school in china at that time. After graduating from Huangpu, he had taken part in WW2, anti-japan war. After the civil war, he didn’t follow Jiang to go Taiwan, and stayed in mainland of china, making contributions to this developing country. </li>
<li>But people’s life always had some difficulties. In culture revolution, he was criticized by officials and red-defenders due to his KMT identity. But <strong>he didn’t abandon himself to despair</strong>konm, he became diligent than before and helped other farmers to learn advanced agricultural knowledge. In the term of reforming and opening, his contributions were praised by the government and he became a well-known people in my county. In his old ages, he also insisted on working and helping farmers.</li>
<li>So his diary was very meaningful and valuable, as his offspring, we have the responsibility to protect his diary well. It represents the spirit of our family</li>

<li>When: I want to share you an experience with you that happened two years ago.</li>
<li>Where: My parents and I had a trip to a scenic spot near Chengdu during National Holidays. On the way to the scenic spot, we met a traffic jam due to the construction of the road. It costed us almost 2 hours to get the old town instead of 30 minutes originally. When we got there, it was extremely crowded. The line of buying ticket was so long that beyond my imagination. You know, the line began from the door of scenic spot, and ended at the park place. I guessed it could be more than 1 km long. </li>
<li>Why: It was said that the scenery was spectacular there and we had spare time to travel.</li>
<li>How you feel: We had to wait in the line for about 1 hours to buy the tickets. I felt extremely exhausted and thirsty. You know, you can only play with you phones and sometimes rise head to see how long you have to wait. (It was more painful than climbing mountains because at least you are walking instead of waiting in a line, feet seemed to be stuck.)</li>
<li>And we didn’t have a place to take a rest because the official of the scenic spot didn’t provide us with any seat. I really suggested that they should offer better service for the tourists.</li>

<li><p>无聊的经历</p>
<ul>
<li>Who you talked with. Two schoolmates </li>
<li>When you had the conversation last year, history course in university. Optional course called the rise and fall of great powers</li>
<li>What you were doing Well, at first, the other two students shared their ideas towards this topic. One student said that the popularity of Tang poetry was highly related to the rise of Tang dynasty. The other one agreed with his idea and added that Tang poetry had reached the top of ancient culture. But for me, I only mentioned one poem which was written by libai. It was a well-known one called In the Silence of Night.</li>
<li>Topic Teacher asked us to talk something about the poetry of Tang dynasty. We were allocated into 6 groups. I had to talk with another two students I have mentioned before.</li>
<li>Why you were not interested I felt bored of this topic during the talking. You know I was an engineering student, I really didn’t have any knowledge about the poetry of Tang, I could only recite some famous poems which were written by Libai\Dufu. But if you asked me to talk meaning of them, I can’t give answers. Secondly, I was a little awkward because I was not familiar with other </li>

<li><p>童年喜欢的玩具</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of toy it is: I am going to talk about a toy that I played in my childhood. This toy is well-known among the world, I think many children have played with it. It originated from Denmark, and the main material of this toy is plastic. Well, it’s Lego.</li>
<li>When you received it: I remembered that I received in my 6-year-old birthday. My parents sent a box of lego as my birthday gift.</li>
<li>How you played it: When I got lego at first time, I didn’t know how to play with such a large amount of bricks. My father told me that there was an instruction which I could follow. So I followed the instruction and finally built a large house. After that, I became crazy about playing lego and asked my parents to buy more bricks for me. I absorbed the constructing concept of instructions and used my imagination to create many interesting, such as a transformer, a large plane…</li>
<li>How you felt about it: First, playing lego really brought happiness to my childhood life. I would also got a sense of achievement when I finished my master piece! In addition, It also inspired my mind about creating and building various things. You know, lego recently has released many products, like the old Trafford, star wars, harry potter, I really want to buy some to feel the unique and simple happiness in my childhood. They remind me of the innocent childhood in my memory</li>

<ul>
<li>What: Biangbiang noodles </li>
<li>When: When I went to Xi’an in 2009, I had a try of Biangbiang noodles.</li>
<li>Where: I remembered I ate it near the ancient wall of Xi’an</li>
<li>How you felt about it: It was different the noodles in my hometown. The noodle bowl was quite large, I could even put my face in it. On the surface of the noodles, you could see the shinning chill oil and pork. The noodle was wider than ordinary noodle, so its big surface would be coated with more sauces and chill oil. It tasted so delicious that I ordered two bowls to satisfy my appetite. The flavor of this noodle combined the northern flavor and the Sichuan flavor, which tasted like sour and hot. </li>
<li>If I can go Xi’an again, I will definitely eat it again.</li>

<li><p>不喜欢的短途旅行 </p>
<ul>
<li>Where, when : I’m going to tell a short trip that I took in my high school years. It was a fixed route between my home and my high school. It was not very long, maybe 15 kilometers. </li>
<li>I would take this trip twice a week. On Saturday, I would go home from school and on Sunday, I would go back school from my home. And the trip from my home to school is the main thing I want mention about</li>
<li>So for the reason why I took this short trip. You know, my high school was a boarding school. I had to live in school from Monday to Saturday. I had only one day off every week to go back home. This situation was mainly caused by the fierce study competition among Chinese students.</li>
<li>For the reasons why I didn’t like this trip, firstly, every time I went on the trip from my home to school, I would like to think back the comfortable life a home, I wanted to play computer games, and I didn’t want to go back to study the difficult math and recite the complex articles. Secondly, the road between my home to my school was always under construction during the three years. We always met traffic jam on the trip due to the road’s construction, which made me feel annoyed. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>喜欢拜访但不想住的家</p>
<ul>
<li>A home that comes to my mind is my cousin’s home. It’s in the suburban area of my city, which is a little far from my home. I had visited his house frequently since he moved in it.</li>
<li>The house is extremely large, including a big living room, 4 bedrooms. The furniture in his house is all wood made, it’s said that all the furniture had costed about 200 thousand yuan. And the electronic products are all brand-new. </li>
<li>For the reason why I enjoyed visiting it. You know, my cousin had a Play station 4 with a lot of games in house. Every time I pay a visit to his house will definitely play it. I am crazy about playing games. And the perineum PS4 is the main reason why I like to go to his home.</li>
<li>But I would not like to live in his home. You know, the suburban area of our city is always under construction. It’s really difficult for me to find a public park if I want to take exercise. Furthermore, the environment there is poor due to the construction of commercial housing, trucks are everywhere. So you may pay attention to your safety because of these running large stuffs</li>
<li>Not like to live there. The suburban of our city is under construction, The infrastructure is incomplete. It’s really difficult for me to find a public park if I want to take exercise. Furthermore, the environment there is poor due to the construction of commercial housing, trucks are everywhere. You must pay attention to your safety because of these running large stuffs.</li>

<li><p>迷路的经历</p>
<ul>
<li>(The experience I am going to tell you happened in my childhood) Honestly, I rarely got lost because I had a great sense of location. But there was still an experience getting lost in my childhood. I remembered I was about 5 years old at that time. My parents and I were walking on the street of the city center and we were going to take a bus to go home.</li>
<li>I followed my parents originally, but suddenly I was attracted by the billboards on the roadside. When I realized that I had to follow my parents, I found that I had got lost. I didn’t know where my parents were and how to get to the bus stop. I was afraid and started crying on the street. At that time, a stranger approached and asked me what happened. I told him I got lost and couldn’t find my parents. He lent his phone to me without any hesitation. I made a phone call to my mother and told her where I was. </li>
<li>Thanks to this stranger. Finally I found my parents and went home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>许下的承诺</p>
<ul>
<li>promise: college entrance examination, enter BUPT or UESTC</li>
<li>to my parents and teacher. It was a promise for myself. Because this promise determined my future development.</li>
<li>difficult to keep. You know, college entrance examination is the biggest examination in the world. I had millions of opponents to compete with.  The examination is very fierce and difficult, and it determines what university you can go to in the future. The process of preparing for CEE was really painful. You may spend 12 hours on study and don’t have any opportunities to play.So this is promise is not a easy one to keep.</li>
<li>For the reason why i made this promise. I think it was my dream to learn IT related knowledge in the future. So getting a good grade in CEE is necessary for me. It was an precious opportunity for me and I was supposed to value this to enter my dream school.</li>

<li>My freind, Yang jiapeng, was actually one of my best friend in my class. We always talked about games and computer hardwares. </li>
<li>Well, the truth was that I had broken his graphic card which he lent to me. I lent his graphics card to run a large game because of its excellent performance. The temperature of the graphics card couldn’t be controlled and core of the graphics card died. I bought a same graphics card at once although it costed me a lot.</li>
<li>Well, initiallly, he was a little bit overwhelmed by the truth I told him, judging by her facial expression.  And he told me don’t put it on heart, graphics card would face problems in some situations you can’t predict. Honestly, I felt embarrased and guilty to break his graphics card.</li>
<li>Well, I think I wanted to tell him the truth was out of my conscience. You know, I was told not to lie to others by my parents since I began my schooling. The feeling of hiding the truth by a lie really sucked during that period of time. I don’t want to hurt anybody in fact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>礼貌的人</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to talk about my friend, whose name is Liang Hui. </li>
<li>He was also my classmate in college. I remembered the first time I met him was in the computer laboratory. We were learning how to program in python, and the teacher came up with an algorithm problem which was a little difficult, and I thought about it for a long time, but Hui Liang wrote the program at once. I was very surprised of his speed. After that, when it came to python class, he would help the students solve their programming problems.</li>
<li>You know, at first, I thought he was the person who didn’t like to talk with others and just stayed at his own world. But the fact was that Liang Hui was an outgoing and polite boy. If you meet him on the road, he would definitely say hello to you. When other people met difficulties in computer or programming, he would like to do other a favor without any payback. </li>
<li>For the reasons why I think he is polite. His behaviors I mentioned before was so polite and he greet every people with the same attitude. In my opinion, he is a very nice person and I feel so honored to have a friend like him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>发挥想象力</p>
<ul>
<li>When it was: I want to share you an experience which happened at last year. The first lesson of AI fundamental. </li>
<li>Why you needed to use imagination: special online courses. To make the class more active, teacher asked us to talk something about AI. The topic was what the AI can be in the future. We were required to use our imagination but not professional knowledge to give some answers.</li>
<li>How difficult: Little difficult. I had not learned something related with AI. It really costed me a while to think about something imaginative. You know, some ideas like computer vision and natural language processing had been deployed in reality world, it was really difficult to come up with some novel ideas. Finally, I proposed that we can combine AI with human brain and make a super human. </li>
<li>Explain how you felt about it: At that time, I thought my idea was really ridiculous. But the teacher encouraged us to suggest different kinds of ideas. For my feeling, I think such kind of task was beneficial to the improvement of our thinking ability. Meanwhile, I would be more curious about this course and wanted to learn something from it. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>教别人的技能</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I think the skill I can teach others should be python programming skills. To be more specific, it contains the basic programming skills including loop, judgement and some advanced skills like data analysis and machine learning.</li>
<li>I acquired knowledge about python two years ago. At that time, I was freshman in university and my first lesson about computer programming was python. I was extremely excited to take this course and learned a lot about python. After a term’s learning, I had a good command of python and I believed that I have the ability to teach others well.</li>
<li>There is a saying “Practice makes perfect”. The best way to teach other this python is through practice. After learning the fundamental knowledge from books, you also need to implement the programs immediately. By learning like this, you would quickly master the knowledge of the skill and it could be difficult for you to forget them if you keep practicing.</li>
<li>You know, python is most popular programming language today. It is used in many fields including information technology, biology, statics… So python is an important skill in today’s technology world. It will not only improve your work efficiency but also exercise your logical thinking.</li>
