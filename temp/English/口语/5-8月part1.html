<li>work or study<ul>
<li>communication skills \ interpersonal relationship </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>House Accommodation<ul>
<li>house: large space, beautiful decoration, garden, invite my friends to my house to hold a party.</li>
<li>dormitory: I live in the campus, so it’s a dormitory. narrow, but nice</li>
<li>Differences: area , furniture and so on. My dormitory is small and there are 4 people sharing this room. All the furniture is very old. But for the flat I used to live in, it was large and the area of it can be 150 square meters. It have several rooms.</li>
<li>Most time room: I believe that it can be the dining room. You know, my members only have time to get together when we eat meals.</li>
<li><strong>Honestly speaking, I prefer to live in the house. Generally, house is bigger than a flat. Some houses even have their own garages and gardens. It’s big enough to provide accommodation for lots of people. I can even hold a party or barbecue in my house. But the fact is that the price of house is extremely exboritant, maybe I can’t afford it in the future. So a flat can be a more realistic choice. Compared to house, flat is much cheaper. The space is small so it’s convenient for me to clean it up</strong></li>
<li>家具</li>
<li>bed: If I’m tired, I can lie on the bed to relax.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Barbecue<ul>
<li>valley trip/near river/took some fresh food/use the water directly</li>
<li>?? Yeah, absolutely. taste good. </li>
<li>Beef, pork, some vegetables like cauliflower(花菜) and leek(韭菜). nutrition</li>
<li>work together can intensify the relationship among us/Enhance ability to work in a team/share happiness together. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sky and stars<ul>
<li>I seldom look at the sky because I am busy with study all the time. I have no time to raise my head to look what’s happening in the sky. I look at sky only when weather change. (ultraviolet is harmful to my health)</li>
<li>I prefer the sky at night. There are a lot of shining stars and bright moon in the sky. It is really a fantastic scene.</li>
<li>Of course yes.Since there is less air pollution in my living area, I can see the moon and stars clearly in the clear sky. The sky there is much clearer than industrialarea where the heavy smoke prevents people from seeing the moon and stars. Urban light pollution will make the night of city very bright, so it’s hard for you to find moons and stars</li>
<li>There is a hill in the park near my home, and it is a great place to look at sky. When I havef ree time, I would like to climb up the hill with my parents and watch the beautiful sky together. It is a precious memory for all of us.</li>
<li>Star: star track, capture the track of stars</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Special Costumes<ul>
<li>Do you like wearing special costumes? <ul>
<li>Actually, I don’t like wear some special or strange costumes and clothes. I’m the kind of people who don’t want to be noticed. But if necessary, for example, I have to perform in a show, I think I will wear these clothes. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did you try any special costumes when you were young?<ul>
<li>Yes, I did. I remember when I was a primary school, my teacher asked me to wear colorful costumes to perform in the Children’s Day celebration. That was the first time I wore a special costume on the stage, which made me feel a bit nervous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When was your last time to wear special costumes?<ul>
<li>Well, I don’t remember the exact time that I wear special costumes. But I still remember that I wore a large Mickey Mouse Suit to perform in our school’s Children’s Day celebration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you ever buy special costumes?<ul>
<li>No, I’ve never bought any special costumes. You know, I am the person who doesn’t want to catch others’ attention(draw attention to myself). Meanwhile, I think I will definitely feel awkward when I wear such a kind of clothes. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being happy<ul>
<li>lately: see my girlfriend. I can’t wait to see her.</li>
<li>keep happy: Learn to be satisfied. </li>
<li>tend to have a longer life. They will suffer from less diseases at old ages. Meanwhile, keeping happy is also nice to make friends, Happiness is contagious</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Car trip</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you like travel by car?<ul>
<li>Yes I do. You know, it’s quite convenient if you can travel by car. You can drive to places that can’t be reached by public transportation. If I feel tired during the trip, I can stop in the park and take a break. Meanwhile, I also have opportunities to enjoy the beautiful scenery on the side of the road.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where is the farthest place you have traveled to by car?<ul>
<li>In my memory, I guessed that the farthest I’ve been to by car is Dunhuang, which is located at the northwest of Mainland China. I remembered that we drove about 2 days to get there. The scenery there was absolutely amazing. I had opportunities to see the vast desert and sacred dun huang culture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you like to sit in the front or back when traveling by car?<ul>
<li>Well, I prefer to sit in the front of the car. You know, it’s easier for me to get car sick if I sit in the back of the car although the space of back seat is spacious. Moreover, I can get access to the car console to use some functions at the front seat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When do you travel by car?<ul>
<li>If the distance of the destination is less than 300 km, I will travel to there by car. It’s more convenient. To some extent, it spends less hours than public transportation. You know, If you take a public transportation, I have to get the station very early and wait for a long time. And you cannot get a exact position. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Primary school</p>
<ul>
<li>like to do: play table tennis with my primary school friends. I always played it on the table tennis table near the teaching building. It was the happies time I had experienced. <strong>I was able to exercise and relieve stress at the same time</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Wild Animals</strong><ul>
<li>Do you like watch TV programs about wild animals?<ul>
<li>Well, I enjoy watching programs about animals. In China, there is a TV program called Animals’ World, which is my favorite TV programs about animals. I have learned a lot knowledge about wild animals, including animals’ migration, reproduction and extinction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did you learn something about wild animals at school? <ul>
<li>Yes, I did. I remember in my primary school years, our science teacher taught us something about wild animals’ protection and the problem of wildlife extinction. It was quite an eye-opener for me who never set foot in the wild. It left me a deep impression and I began to pay attention to this severe problem in today’s world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where can you see wild animals?<strong>???</strong><ul>
<li>In natural reserves, you can see a lot of wild animals, including. But you must pay attention to your safety. You know, some wild animals are so fierce and they will hurt people. </li>
<li>I guess we can <strong>detect</strong> those animals in places that have fewer people. For instance they usually appear in the mountains, rivers, and the sea where nobody frequently disturbs them. Alsom forests, where there are lots of trees, provide good habitats for those wild animals. So, it’s easy for us to see them there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In which country do you think you can see many wild animals?<ul>
<li>I believe that I can see a variety of wild animals in Africa. Because Africa has the most original environment, which means wildlife have better environment and conditions to make a live there. Moreover, The continent that appears most frequently in animal documentaries is Africa. So I also have the stereotype that there are many wild animals in Africa. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maths</li>
<li><strong>Holidays</strong><ul>
<li>I remember that last holiday I went to Wuhan with my classmates in 2020 national holidays. We paid a visit to some tourist attractions in Wuhan, like museums, east lake, Yangtze River brigde. We were happy to see that Wuhan was recovering from pandemic.</li>
<li>Defitely. an escape from heavy workload. travel to some peaceful and quiet places, relieve my pressure and save my energy. Then I can go back with full of energy and throw myself into work again. </li>
<li>National Day has the longest holiday. Spring festival, go back home to have family reunion.</li>
<li>During holidays, I prefer to travel to other places with my friends. Traveling is good way to expand my horizons by seeing different customs and cultures beautiful scenery. Meanwhile, I can enjoy happy time with my friends. strengthen our friendship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Relax</strong><ul>
<li>Well, for me, the way I relax is riding bike in suburban area. I can have an escape…. Although my physical energy is consumed by riding bike, my mentality get relaxed</li>
<li>Yes. As I mentioned before, I believe that doing sport is an <strong>effective</strong> way to relax. I will forget all the worries when I do sports. ( You can take your minds from some tedious things or busy works, your study) Meanwhile, after the sports, your bodies’ muscle will be deeply relax. Some chemicals released from your brain will stimulate you and make you feel more energetic.</li>
<li>Absolutely. Vacation is always a long period. You can arrange your vacation well and have an escape from….travel to some places</li>
<li>Absolutely. Today, many students are under too much pressure. Their teachers and parents ask them to study hard and enter a good university in the future. Some students are locked in school and don’t have any free time. It is not good for their body and mental health. They need to balance their study and relax well, it is important for their health and it can also improve their study effiency if they have enough relaxing time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
<li><strong>Flowers</strong><ul>
<li>Are there any flowers that have special meanings in China?<ul>
<li>Of course yes, every flower has its special meaning. Flowers’ meanings like a mystery for me, I am unaware of some of them. For me One flower that comes in my mind is chinese rose. It indicates fortune and luck. People would like to send chinese rose to other people to express their respect and love. I don’t know that if other countries have the same meaning for this kind of flower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Window View</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tree</strong><ul>
<li>To be honest, although I think I may like planting trees, I haven’t done it before. If I have some opportunities to plant trees, I will definitely have a try. You know, planting trees a kind of way to protect our environment and slow down the global warming.</li>
<li>Honestly, I don’t know any names and species of trees in China. I only know that in south of China, many places would like to plant some trees which are green but not very tall. In contrast, the trees in northern China seem to be taller and their leaves will turn to yellow in autumn. So in my hometown, trees usually remain green all the seasons.</li>
<li>As I mentioned before, I’ve never planted trees. Although my school holds tree planting acitivity every year, I don’t participate in it. Because I am always very busy. In fact, I really want to plant trees if I have spare time. We all know that planting trees is a good way to improve our environmental conditions.</li>
<li>In the future, I plan to plant bamboos. You know, bamboo is straight and tall, many ancient chinese poets would use bamboo to write poems which represents noble character. Meanwhile, I can plant bamboo in my backyard, and their requirement of living conditions is not very high, it’s easy to keep bamboo alive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Festival</strong><ul>
<li>food: dumplings and noodles, which indicate fortune and long life. During mid-autumn festival, mooncake, with some special stuff in it, like eggs, fruits. During dragon boat festival, we will enjoy zongzi in memory of quyuan in ancient china.</li>
<li>miss for family members</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wallet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No, I’ve used a wallet. As far as I’m concerned, it’s not very convenient to bring a wallet. If you want buy something, you have to take your wallet out at first and then find you money. And you know, Today we seldom use cash, we can use our mobile phones to pay for money, there is no need to bring a wallet.</li>
<li>As I mentioned before, I’ve used a wallet. But I had experience losing my cash. You know, when I took out something from my pocket, my cash will also be taken out. And at that time, I didn’t concentrate on my money, so it got lost.</li>
<li>No. I don’t. I don’t think wallet is a good gift.</li>
<li>No. e-Pay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Environment Protection</p>
<ul>
<li>The environment problems are becoming really severe. Working in a company that makes contributions to environmental protection can not only guarantee my basic living needs, I can also do something for the environment to make our world better</li>
<li>Every one should put efforts into protecting environemnt. For individuals, we should live a low-carbon life, which can slow down the global warming. Secondly, we should learn how to recycle some wastes, it will save energy and resources for our earth. For government, policies and laws should be carried out to limit the output of pollutants and punish the people who destroy the environment.</li>
<li>No, I don’t think. Although I will save water and paper every day, I don’t believe that it’s enough. I should do more things including recycling my waste, using renewable bags and taking public transportation. I should do much more efforts to protect our environment.</li>
<li>Yes. In my country, all students will be taught the importantce of protecting environment by their teachers. Teachers will also lead children to do practical activities to protect our environment, including recycling, throw garbage into the right dustin, pick up the waste… It is the <strong>common sense</strong> that every one should have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Advertisement</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertisements are everywhere. And there are various advertisements in our life. Commercial advertisements are the most common. When you open the application in your phone, you will the advertisements. When you go shopping, you will also see a lot of outdoor commercial advertisements. Some other types of advertiements like medical advertisements, employing advertisements</li>
<li>Yes, I have such an experience. Last year, I seen the advertisement of iPhone 12 mini from Apple Inc. I was attracted by its tiny design and powerful chips which were introduced in its ad. So I bought one this year. And it’s a nice product. Apple didn’t do fake propaganda.</li>
<li>Yes, especially for the ad which propagate electronic products. You know I am a big fan of these things. Related ad can catch my eyes and I want to know the whole details of electronic products.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Museum<ul>
<li>Do you think museums are important?<ul>
<li>Important. Museums provide the public with the opportunity to visit historical relics and works of art, enriching the cultural life and knowledge of the public. Meanwhile, The museum is also an important place to preserve cultural relics and collect artworks. It records our history and culure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are there any museums in your hometown?<ul>
<li>Yes, there are lots of museums in my hometown, including history museum, geography museum… My favorite one is the history museum, which holds many artifacts from 2000 years ago to the 20th century. The large bronze tree is the most famous treasure in histroy museum, it’s said this tree was made by workers in shang dynasty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you often visit a museum?<ul>
<li>Yes, I visit museums once a month on average. In my opinions, visiting museum is a good way to learn different aspects knowledge. Meanwhile, I can also relieve my pressure from intensive study in university.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When was the last time you visited a museum?<ul>
<li>Last time I paid a visit to Sanxingdui Museum in Guanghan in January. I went there with my friend and we were expected to see the miraculous sanxingdui culture. This museum was absolutely amazing, it really left me a deep impression, especially the bronze mask. I didn’t how to describe the details of this mask. You cannot believe that ancient people in 2000 years ago had the ability to make such a elegant(elaborate精细的) thing</li>
